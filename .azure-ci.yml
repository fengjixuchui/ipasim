# For more information, see `/scripts/ci/README.md`.

# Here are variables you have to set, so that this build can function:
#
# `docker.password` ...password to Docker repository `ipasim`.
# `azure.key`, `azure.app.id`, `azure.tenant` ...see `/scripts/ci/README.md` for
# more details.
# `azure.subscription.id` ...ID of the subscription the VM is located in.
#
# Here are variables you can configure the build with along with values you can
# set for them:
#
# `pull.docker.image`: 1 ...pulls the Docker image instead of building it.
# `pull.build.artifacts`: 1 ...pulls Docker image containing build artifacts,
# effectively doing an incremental build.
# `shutdown.when.complete`: 1 ...shutdowns the computer in the end. This is
# deprecated. See job `StopVM` below.
# `reset.repository`: 1 ...removes and then clones sources from scratch
# (otherwise, if the repo already exists locally, it's only incrementally
# updated to the latest version).
# `build.tablegens.only`: 1 ...runs only a sample build command (bulding just
# tablegens). This can be used to test incremental building (see also i14).
#
# Note that these variables are converted to uppercase and have dots replaced
# with underscores before being visible as environment variables in batch
# scripts.
#
# Set listed variables to 1 (others to 0) if you want to...
# ...rebuild artifacts (default): `pull.docker.image`;
# ...rebuild everything (even Docker image `ipasim/build`): `reset.repository`;
# ...build incrementally: `pull.build.artifacts`;
# ...test the workflow (build only small target): `build.tablegens.only`.
