# Installation

This document describes steps necessary to install the emulator from [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/releases).

1. Make sure you have Windows 10, build 1809 or later.
2. Download and extract `ipasim-build-v*.zip` of your chosen
   [release](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/releases).
3. Run script `Add-AppDevPackage.ps1` from the extracted files. Follow
   instructions in the console. If successful, you will have the emulator
   installed on your machine (it's called `ipaSim`).

## Samples

If you don't have your own iOS app to emulate, you can use a prebuilt sample.

1. Download and extract `ipasim-samples-v*.zip` of your chosen
   [release](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/releases) or some previous
   one (samples may not be built that often).
2. Launch `ipaSim` and select one of the extracted folders (it must have suffix
   `.app`).
