# Porting

This document contains general notes about porting Windows libraries to UWP
(Universal Windows Platform), since there is a lot of such porting in this
project.

## Using native `.dll`s in UWP apps

It's possible to build classical Win32 `.dll`s (or download prebuilt ones) and
use them from an UWP app. Simply add the `.dll` into the project with property
`Content` set to `True` (so that it gets copied into the resulting `.appx`).

If there are some dependent `.dll`s that the target platform doesn't contain,
though, it will end with error `-1073741515 (0xc0000135) 'A dependent dll was
not found'`. To debug this, see for example [this StackOverflow
question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/44659598) and the links it contains.

These native `.dll`s are usually for Win32 platform only. To build them for ARM,
just add ARM platform in Configuration Manager in Visual Studio. This alone
won't do the trick, though, since building for ARM is disabled by default
(you'll get error `MSB8022: Compiling Desktop applications for the ARM platform
is not supported.`). To overcome this, just add
`<WindowsSDKDesktopARMSupport>true</WindowsSDKDesktopARMSupport>` to the
`.vcxproj`'s `<PropertyGroup Label="Globals">`. See for example [blog post on
pete.akeo.ie](http://pete.akeo.ie/2017/05/compiling-desktop-arm-applications-with.html)
for more details.

To sum up, using native `.dll`s in UWP apps can be very problematic - on
Desktop, everything will probably work fine, but on other platforms, some
`.dll`s can be missing, and it's very hard to debug that. Also, if the library
actually calls something that's not supported on UWP, some stub function will be
called, which will probably just return `NULL` or something like that (and that
may or may not be the correct behavior for our application).

## Creating UWP `.dll` project

So, an alternative and better approach is to create an UWP `.dll` project in
Visual Studio, adding the original source code files into it and finally
creating our own stub functions which will do what makes sense for our
application.

### Why should we build for UWP

After all, only difference is that it uses `api-ms-*` umbrella `.dll`s instead
of `kernel32.dll` (if done properly - i.e., if built against UWP's
`platform.winmd` - see [docs on Objective-C runtime](objc.md), section Porting,
for more information). Well, [umbrella
libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/apiindex/windows-umbrella-libraries)
are in fact just virtual `.dll`s (they don't exist anywhere on disk), they are
mapped to physical `.dll`s (like `kernel32.dll`, `kernelbase.dll`, etc.) by
`ApiSetSchema.dll` mapping library. See [this StackOverflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47530043/9080566), where it's described.

**TODO: But does that have any pros or cons?** As I see it now, those
`api-ms-*.dll`s might only contain the high-level (i.e., structured) WinRT APIs
and not the low-level ones (i.e., plain C, good old Win32 APIs). Or, maybe they
contain both, but the high-level ones cannot be found elsewhere (or at least not
easily, because since they're umbrella libraries, all the APIs must technically
exist elsewhere).

## Comments in code

When porting code by copying it (or cloning from a remote repository, etc.), we
add comments prefixed with `[port]` to indicate that those are our comments. And
all changes to the source code are described by nearby comments prefixed with
`[port] CHANGED:`.

Also, in `C`-based code, there are `#ifdef`s around the changed code, so that
the changes are only effective if some preprocessor definition is passed to the
compiler (e.g., in `objc` library, this is `OBJC_PORT` definition).

**TODO: Maybe we shouldn't ever change the original source code directly, but
rather create a new branch in a repository containing just the dependency, then
making the changes in this separate branch and adding it as a submodule. This
way, we could easily update the dependency by pulling changes into the branch
with the original code and then merging it with the branch containing the
changes. Still, comments explaining those changes should be added, though.**
