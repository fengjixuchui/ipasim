# `i28`: [cg] Functions returning small structures

## Problem

See `samples/issue28.mm`. When compiled using
`clang -target armv7s-apple-ios10 -fobjc-runtime=ios-11 -c issue28.mm -o issue28a.o`,
method `getMeSmallStr` returns the small structure through hidden first
argument. When compiled using
`clang -target i386-pc-windows-msvc -fobjc-runtime=ios-11 -c issue28.mm -o issue28b.obj`,
the same method returns the same structure in registers and there is no hidden
argument.

## Possible solution

See field `IsRetSmallStructInRegABI` of class `X86_32ABIInfo` in Clang's
`TargetInfo.cpp`. If we set this to `false`, then Clang would maybe return small
structures through hidden first parameter for `i386-pc-windows-msvc`, as well.

## Our solution

But this should also be solvable with codegen. If we generated correct wrappers,
everything would probably work. We currently do this simply by checking if the
number of arguments is the same for the PDB symbol and signature from iOS
headers. Ideally, we should just get `llvm::FunctionType` from the PDB symbol
and generate DLL wrappers using that signature. But getting `llvm::FunctionType`
from PDB symbol is not easy. Also, this might not work by itself as we probably
need to do special codegen, as well, see below.

```cpp
struct str {
  int x, y;
};

// The iOS (ARM) wrapper.
void foo(str **ret, int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    str **ret;
    int *arg0;
    char ***arg1;
  } s;
  s.ret = &ret;
  s.arg0 = &argc;
  s.arg1 = &argv;
  $__ipaSim_wrapper_foo(&s);
}

// The DLL (i386) wrapper.
void $__ipaSim_wrapper_foo(void *args) {
  struct {
    str **ret;
    int *arg0;
    char ***arg1;
  } *argsp = (decltype(argsp))args;
  // Here we call the real native function.
  **(argsp->ret) = foo(*argsp->arg0, *argsp->arg1);
}
```
