# `i19`: [objc] Handle errors manually

## Problem

We should catch errors, like calls to `_objc_fatal`, and report them. Currently,
the app just crashes.

## Partial solution

We write the error to the debugging console for starters.

## Future work

It would be nice to also stop the debugger inside `objc-errors.mm`. Currently,
the debugger doesn't do anything, the whole apps stops and we have to set
a breakpoint manually to actually inspect the error (its stack trace, etc.).
