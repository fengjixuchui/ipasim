# `i24`: [cg] Creating wrapper for UCRT

## Problem

When creating `.wrapper.dll` for UCRT, there are some problems. First, it
exports aliased functions, i.e., functions with the same RVAs but different
names. This is not handled well by `HeadersAnalyzer` right now.

## Possible solutions

Utility `dumpbin` does this right. It can read `.pdb` if it's located along the
analyzed `.dll` and it correctly assigns functions and their aliases with
underscore prefix from the `.pdb`. If we could do that, we could also analyze
only the correct functions from the `.pdb`s (i.e., only DLL-exported functions).

Or we could simply import by RVAs instead of names. This solution assumes that
aliased functions have the same signature, and so we could analyze just one of
the aliases.

## Wrong solution

Since we generate the wrapping `.lib` manually, we tried simply adding the
missing aliases there. But that causes the `ucrtbased.wrapper.dll` to be
unloadable at runtime, because it imports symbols that `ucrtbased.dll` doesn't
export.

## Our solution

We created `stubs.cpp` and linked them with `ucrtbased.wrapper.dll`.
