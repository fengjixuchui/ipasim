# `i21`: [llvm] Symbol `dyld_stub_binder`

## Problem

Symbol `dyld_stub_binder` is generated into Dylibs by Clang, but it's then left
unresolved. On Apple platform, this is probably solved by linking to `libSystem`
which exports this symbol.

## Solution

Since this symbol is a stub anyway, we simply tweaked LLD to ignore it.
