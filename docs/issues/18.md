# `i18`: [woc] Bridge types in `+initialize`

## Introduction

Some CoreFoundation and Foundation types are bridged together (e.g., `NSArray`
and `CFArray`). This is done by calling function `_CFRuntimeBridgeTypeToClass`.

Originally, this bridging function was called from `+load` method of the
corresponding Foundation class (e.g., `NSArray`). This was implemented for many
such pairs of classes by macro `BRIDGED_CLASS_REQUIRED_IMPLS`.

## Problem

If the bridge is not set, it can cause trouble. And the bridge may not be set if
some Foundation class calls some bridged Foundation class from its `+load`
method.

As a concrete example, consider class `NSURLProtocol_file`. It calls some
`NSURLProtocol`'s method from its `+load` method. `NSURLProtocol` in turns tries
to create an instance of `NSMutableArray`. But if `NSURLProtocol`'s `+load`
method is called before `NSMutableArray`'s one, `NSMutableArray` will be
unbridged, causing its initialization to fail.

## Solution

There's another method similar to `+load`. It's called `+initialize` and the
Objective-C runtime calls it before sending any message to the object that
defines it.

But our Objective-C runtime considers all objects without `+load` method as lazy
and postpones their initialization. That can be problem for bridged classes
since they're sometimes used in weird ways where postponed initialization
doesn't work.

Therefore, it's ideal to bridge classes inside both `+initialize` and `+load`
methods.
