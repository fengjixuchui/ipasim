# `i14`: [build] Continuous incremental builds

## Problem

Because Git doesn't store modification time of files, incremental builds on
build servers are hard.

## Possible solutions

It is actually possible to store modification times in Git using third-party
tools. See [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13284229) for more
information. Or we could just update the Git repository instead of removing and
cloning it all over again every time.
