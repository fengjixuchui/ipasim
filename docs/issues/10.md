# `i10`: [build] Building XAML files with MSBuild in Docker

## Problem

One solution for [issue i9](9.md) needs to use MSBuild to build UWP C++ project.
But it seems that our Docker image misses some MSBuild files to do that. See
[Visual Studio problem 48484](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/48484/visual-studio-2017-build-tools-does-not-support-bu.html).

## Attempts

We tried to add Visual Studio component
`Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.UWP.BuildTools`, but it didn't resolve
the problem. Another possibility would be to simply copy the necessary files
from working installation.
