# `i13`: [woc] Copying include files

## Problem

In WinObjC, the build system (MSBuild) copies header files around at build time.
Other files then include those copied files. To be compatible, we must do the
same thing.

## Details

See `<CoreFoundationPublicHeader>` nodes in `sdk-build.props`. Those are copied
into `WinObjC/include/CoreFoundation`. Similarly, files specified by
`<CoreFoundationPrivateHeader>` nodes are copied into `WinObjC/Include`. See
also `WinObjC/.gitignore` where target files are enumerated explicitly.

## Future work

Better thing to do would be to copy the headers into CMake binary dir. Now we
copy them inside source tree which is wrong. Or we could include the original
headers or maybe move the original headers.
