# `i15`: [build] Ninja error opening build log

## Problem

Sometimes, we try tu run multiple Ninja commands in the same working directory
in parallel. Those processes both try to access the same build log `.ninja_log`
and maybe also some other shared files. So one of those processes fails with the
error `ninja: error: opening build log: Permission denied` or something similar.

## Proposed solution

We should group all Ninja commands in the same directory into one Ninja pool. If
CMake cannot do this, we could use the `console` pool. That can be done from
CMake using `USES_TERMINAL`.

Another solution would be to create a wrapper executable around Ninja. This tool
would lock some file in working directory, so that only one Ninja would run at a
time. Started implementation of such tool can be seen in `/src/ninja-wrapper/`.

## Chosen solution

Eventually, we chose to group all Ninja commands into the `console` pool. This
has also the advantage of seeing progress of big sub-builds immediately and
having the option to terminate them via Ctrl-C. Disadvantage of this approach is
that all those Ninja commands must run synchronously, i.e., it's slower.
