# `i7`: [build] Failing to pull submodule PlistCpp

## Problem

In Azure DevOps build:

```
error: Server does not allow request for unadvertised object 51f3a6e246ec8ae9adae8984a7b7e22c122d678c
Fetched in submodule path 'deps/WinObjC/tools/vsimporter/third-party/PlistCpp', but it did not contain 51f3a6e246ec8ae9adae8984a7b7e22c122d678c. Direct fetching of that commit failed.
Failed to recurse into submodule path 'deps/WinObjC'
```

See
[build #20181226.5](https://jjones.visualstudio.com/ipasim-build/_build/results?buildId=626).

## Cause

The problem is in `--depth`. See [an SO answer](https://superuser.com/a/1286550)
that describes it best. See also another
[comprehensive SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17692710).

## Solution

We forked all submodules (recursively), adding branches `port` to them pointing
to the desired commits, effectively making them advertised.
