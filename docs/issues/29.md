# `i29`: [config] Git LFS is too limiting on GitHub

## Problem

Git LFS on GitHub is limited to [1 GB per
month](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage).
We have lots of objects in LFS, mainly in submodule WinObjC.

## Solution

We use external LFS server. We chose Azure DevOps, since it doesn't seem to have
any limits. See `.lfsconfig` files for actual server URLs.
