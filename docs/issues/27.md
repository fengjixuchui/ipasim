# `i27`: [woc] Workaround `libdispatch.dll`

## Problem

WinObjC's `libdispatch.dll` is not integrated with Objective-C like the real
`libdispatch` on iOS is. This means its objects are not Objective-C objects, but
iOS binaries expect they are. They call `_objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue`
and similar functions on them.

## Possible solutions

We could port original Apple's `libdispatch.dll`, but that seems like a very
complex task.

## Our solution

Instead, we implemented a workaround for now. We simply look if an object comes
from `libdispatch` and if it does, we ignore it inside `libobjc`'s functions.
