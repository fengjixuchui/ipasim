# `i25`: [cg] Linking wrappers with C runtime libraries

## Problem

By default, `clang` links DLLs with `libcmt`. That's mostly OK unless we
generate wrappers for UCRT library. It then causes some duplicate exports which
are linking errors.

## Solution

We can simply pass `-nostdlib` to Clang, so that it doesn't link `libcmt`.
That's OK since we create just wrappers that don't actually need C runtime. But
they still need to have C runtime initialization, so we have to link
`msvcrt`/`msvcrtd` manually.
