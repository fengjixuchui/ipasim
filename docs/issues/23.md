# `i23`: [cg] Re-exporting data symbols

## Problem

Aside from function wrappers, we also need to export data symbols from wrapper
Dylibs. They obviously need to be re-exported from the original WinObjC DLLs, so
that they point to the same data.

## Possible solutions

Ideally, we would like to list all those data symbols in wrapper Dylibs
explicitly.

## Our solution

Currently, because it's the easiest thing to do, we re-export whole DLLs from
wrapper Dylibs. It means that the wrapper Dylibs re-export all symbols from all
relevant DLLs. Relevant DLLs are those where there is at least one data symbol
that needs to be re-exported by the wrapper Dylib.

This is not ideal since it can also re-export symbols we don't want to.

Technically, this is done via `LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB` commands. We actually had to
implement support for emitting them into `lld` ourselves. Option
`-reexport_library` is used for that.
